# Salary-Based Subsidy Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a logistic regression model using Python to predict the eligibility of individuals for a salary-based subsidy. The goal is to create a tool that can assist in determining whether an individual qualifies for a subsidy based on their salary.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Model:** The core of the project is the implementation of a logistic regression model. This model will be trained on a dataset containing information about individuals' salaries and subsidy eligibility.

- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is implemented using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset will undergo thorough preprocessing to handle missing values, scale features if necessary, and encode categorical variables. This ensures the data is suitable for training the logistic regression model.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step is crucial to ensure the reliability of the model in making subsidy eligibility predictions.

Dataset:
Obtain the dataset containing information about individuals' salaries and subsidy eligibility. Place the dataset in the data directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Execute the Jupyter Notebook Salary_classification.ipynb to walk through the entire project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
